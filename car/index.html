          <p>In October 2015, Bill and I got this car project.</p>
          <p>Bill had a 280ZX in high school, it was a 2 seater T-Top model painted in the 10th Anniversary Black/Red color combo. Only 500 of this edition with this paint scheme were made. He ended up driving it to California and sold it.</p>
          <p>We talked about getting a Z as a project car, and started skimming craigslist ads. We thought it would be cool to do together, and I wanted to learn more about cars and thought the old Zs look badass, yet you rarely see them. We bought a 1977 280Z in 2015, it was already taken apart by the previous owner as he had planned to restore it and do a V6 engine swap. The original transmission and engine were gone, but we got a fairly low rust (for z's) body with a lot of the dismantling already done for us, and a bunch of spare parts and upgrades.</p>
          <p>Since the car was already stripped but we needed it on a tow bed, Bill sat on a bucket in the car to control the steering and braking while the previous owner gave it a tow with a strap. It was a funny sight and unfortunately led to some minor damage when Bill found out at a stop that the brakes didn't actually work.</p>

          <p>Our first plan was to get the body sandblasted or otherwise stripped in some way. So our first task was removing remaining interior pieces, lines, rubber bits and bolts. Progress was slow as we had a lot to learn and weren't sure how to proceed. I was anxious about forgetting things we'd done or losing pieces we'd taken off (not to mention all the things that had been taken off already by the previous owner). We got some stuff done, but with winter approaching we decided to store the car in the yard with a cover so that we had use of the garage. We hit a roadblock with trying to find a company that would strip the car.</p>

          <p>I deployed at the start of the year and we didn't get back to the car until May, with plans to strip it ourselves. We began to build a tip-over jig out of plywood and 2x6's to be mounted to the bumper bolts. This would allow us to put the car fully on its side. Unfortunately we got busy again, and made infrequent progress with the car. Things really stalled in 2018 when Bill went to Montana, and we talked about what to do with the car. I was concerned we would never finish it, and we had been digging deeper into buying a crate Chevy 350 engine and a transmission. It seemed expensive and challenging to me. We both thought the best would be to get a Z engine, preferably a L28ET from a 280ZX.</p>
          <p>In April 2019, Dale, the guy that sold us our Z, was now trying to sell a second Z. He had got this car from a local Z mechanic and enthusiast, which was a 1977 280Z with a L28ET engine and rebuilt transmission. The only thing - the car had been in a rear end wreck that twisted the frame. We ended up buying the car for the engine and transmission. With two non-functioning cars now fully occupying the garage and an absurd amount of parts, we were reinvigorated to get this project done.

          <p>We cut off the bashed and beaten frame rails and welded on aftermarket slip over frame rails. We stripped paint and undercoat and treated for rust. We welded patches in the floorboards and in the fender area. We painted the whole underside with POR-15.</p>
