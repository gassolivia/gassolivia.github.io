          <p>Way back in 2015, Bill and I got this car project.</p>
          <p>Bill had a 280ZX in high school, it was a 2 seater T-Top model painted in the 10th Anniversary Black/Red color combo. Only 500 of this edition with this paint scheme were made. He ended up driving it to California and sold it.</p>
          <p>We talked about getting a Z as a project car, and started skimming craigslist ads. We thought it would be cool to do together, and I wanted to learn more about cars and thought the old Zs look badass, yet you rarely see them. We bought a 1977 280Z in 2015, it was already taken apart by the previous owner as he had planned to restore it and do a V6 engine swap. The original transmission and engine were gone, but we got a fairly low rust (for z's) body with a lot of the dismantling already done for us, and a bunch of spare parts and upgrades.</p>
          <p>Since the car was already stripped but we needed it on a tow bed, Bill sat on a bucket in the car to control the steering and braking while the previous owner gave it a tow with a strap. It was a funny sight and unfortunately led to some minor damage when Bill found out at a stop that the brakes didn't actually work.</p>
