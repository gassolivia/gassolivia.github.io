                <p>We took the train from Sittard to check out Ghent! We stayed at the Marriott, surrounded by centuries-old guild houses, in what we later learned was the former port bar and brothel. We learned about the city's history, rebellious spirit and fun stories on the city walking tour. We had some great food including lunch at an adorable teahouse called Alice, a small plates dinner we had at this little place called Joan, and Neuhaus chocolates. We did a lot of wandering and admiring architecture, and the city is just as lovely at night. Next time I'd like to go on one of the boats on the quay, maybe stay at the hostel, get some Belgian stew, visit the "Grandma candy" store, and try more of their fantastic beer.</p>

                <p>We took the train to Amsterdam. The train station itself is gorgeous. We stayed at the Waldorf Astoria, on the herengracht, the canal that housed the most influential and richest members of the city in the 17th century. The hotel is made of several of these prominent houses combined. We had a fantastic dinner at The Seafood Bar in Spui, celebrating my promotion to Major! Wandering, we quickly stumbled upon the infamous Red Light District, taking in the *ahem* sites, and grabbed a chocolate smothered waffle to eat at the side of the canal.</p>

                <p>In the morning, we had breakfast at the hotel's Peacock Alley which was tasty and elegant with a variety of small plates. We followed with a visit to the Rijksmuseum, one of Amsterdam's most prominent museums, of the many, many museums they have. Its the largest art museum in the country, and with our limited attention span we made straight for the Rembrandt's and Vermeer's. Art appreciation complete, we made our way through the flower markets and tried one of the many herring vendors, eating the salted fish with onion and pickles (it was tasty and energizing after a lot of walking). After a quick tour of a local market, we had some pretty stellar ramen at Hinata, a place we happened upon. That afternoon we made for the other side of Amsterdam for an experience staying on a budget-priced hotel boat... I would not recommend staying at a budget-priced hotel boat, though it was an experience. Later, we grabbed a drink at the Cafe de Sluyswacht, a 1695 leaning building that used to house the keeper of the canal lock.</p>

                <p>On our final day, we finally did the "must" of Amsterdam, a canal tour by boat. Waiting for our tour, we explored the Canal Museum, which had a display on art restoration in a beautifully ornate building. Even though our boat tour started with some sprinkling rain, it was absolutely worth it to take in the city from yet another view and learn more of the history. We learned the Waldorf hotel itself was a bit of a scandal, as they bought up multiple properties on the canal in secret and then combined those interiors to the hotel it is now.</p>
                <p>Next visit, I'd like to see the Brouwerij 'T Ij, an Amsterdam brewery at a windmill (though apparently its owned by Belgians now? All the better). We meant to see Micropia, a microbiology museum (waterbears!), and the Anne Frank House, and I wouldn't say no to the Waldorf's Afternoon Tea. We also didn't explore the North side that you can reach by free ferry, and people often recommend visiting Haarlem to the West instead altogether.</p>
