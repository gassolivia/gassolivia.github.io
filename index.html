          <p>The Paris Plan! The map shows three loops, one for each day we have to explore Paris. The selector in the top left of the map can show you the layers so you can view one day at a time. The points of interest are connected by Google walking directions, but we will be using the underground metro system, the bus and this tourist ferry on the Seine called the "batobus". We have a walking tour each day. Highlights of Day 1 (purple markers) are the Catacombs, Tour Montparnasse, Eiffel Tower, and Paris Landmarks walking tour. Highlights of Day 2 (yellow markers) are the Louvre, Paleontology Museum, Ile de City (St Chapelle, Conciergerie, Notre Dame), and the Haunted Paris walking tour. Highlights of Day 3 (green markers) are the Montmarte walking tour and the Palais Garnier.</p>

            <h3>Mullerthal, Luxembourg</h3>
            <time datetime="2021-10-01T08:00">1-2 Oct 21</time>
          </header>

          <img src="img/mullerthal.jpg" alt="Mullerthal Trail">

          <p>We decided to see what Luxembourg is about. Immediately in my search, I found the Mullerthal region, dubbed Luxembourg’s “Little Switzerland”. This area is known for its unique rock formations and has a well developed and extensive trail network connecting towns in the region. We stayed at Camping Martbusch in the town of Berdorf, in our first-ever “pod” glamping experience. This was a simple arched wooden structure with two beds, outlets and folding chairs and a table to enjoy on the small patio. This was a really fun, clean (cheap!) place to stay, and located right next to the very helpful visitor center, a restaurant and the Mullerthal Trail. We are determined to come back, better equipped and with warmer weather and friends to fully enjoy this place.</p>

          <div id="mullerthal" class="more">
            <p>After settling in, we hiked a short loop from the campgrounds that takes you through valleys and onto plateaus on these massive sedimentary rock formations. We were told you could find shell imprints on the rock, which we didn’t find but there was a lot of evidence of erosion by water. We discovered this is a popular climbing spot and came across climbers making final descents as the day waned. Part of the trail you go through a narrow cave and ascend a steep ladder at the end, which was spooky and fun.</p>
            <p>The next day we hiked the trail down to the town of Echternach and took the bus back. This trail took us past more massive rock towers and caves and fissures. One of the first sights is the Huel Lee Cave, which is known for the circular gouged marks left all along its interior as the result of medieval mining for millstones. Once in Echternach, we grabbed a surprisingly tasty mac and cheese pie from an irish pub, saw the town cathedral, and caught the bus back to the car. We learned that in Luxembourg, all public transportation is free!</p>
            <img src="img/vianden.jpg" alt="Vianden Castle">
            <p>After our hike, we scratched plans to see the Schiessentümpel Waterfall (next time!) instead making for Vianden to check out the restored medieval castle. We were a bit rushed for time and none of the plaques were in English, so we breezed through. The castle is massive and underwent a major restoration project that only finished in 1990, after being partially dismantled in the early 1800s. Apparently it even played a role in Luxembourg resistance to Nazi invasion in WWII.</p>

          <img src="img/zeeland.jpg" alt="Zeeland Delta Works">

          <p>We did a daytrip to the west coast of the Netherlands to see the Delta Works storm surge barrier, and the Kinderdijk windmills on the way home. Driving into Zeeland, the scenery reminded us of Anacortes, Washington, with open farm fields and low hills. Zeeland (“zee” means sea) is known for its shellfish farming and we were able to get local oysters and fish at the Seafarm Restaurant for lunch.</p>

          <div id="zeeland" class="more">
            <p>Afterwards we went to the “Delta Park Neeltje Jans” where we were able to tour the storm surge barrier and learn more about the history of its development. It is a really impressive civil engineering project that preserves the natural environment while protecting the region from flooding. In the event of a storm surge, large gates are lowered by hydraulic pistons, meeting with the sea bed to create a temporary dam. At this complex we also toured a small aquarium, a creepy walk-through whale exhibit, and met a couple seals. At the end, we boarded a tour boat that did a 45-minute tour of the estuary, and Bill got some good seagull closeups with the camera.</p>
            <img src="img/kinderdijk.jpg" alt="Kinderdijk Windmills">
            <p>From there, we left the coast for a more ancient location related to the Dutch’s war with the sea. At Kinderdijk, there stand nineteen 18th-century windmills, used to pump water for flood control of the low-lying polders. We were unable to visit the visitors center or the museum, but we were able to have a beautiful relaxed stroll down the canal along the windmills. With the setting sun, Bill was able to get some awesome photos with his camera.</p>

          </header>

          <img src="img/dusseldorf.jpg" alt="Düsseldorf Königsallee">

          <p>For the weekend, we drove to Düsseldorf, the capital of our region of Germany, North Rheinland Westphalia (NRW for short). The city is on the Rhine River and is named for the Düssel that feeds into it here. We started with a free walking tour, learning that Düsseldorf has a strong steel industry and a rivalry with upstream Cologne. Cologne used to be the capital of NRW, but after WWII, even though Düsseldorf had been bombed significantly, it was deemed in better shape than Cologne to take on the role of the Capital.</p>

          <div id="düsseldorf" class="more">
            <p>We visited the Alt Stadt (Old City), known for its Alt beer and the longest bar in the world. Nearby at the Rathaus (city hall) we learned of the tradition that at the start of Carnival a jester in a mustard pot makes jokes about the last year, while the Mayor stands at the Rathaus balcony. We walked the Königsallee (King's Avenue), which is a tree-lined canal bordered by high end shops and corporate offices. That evening we went to Little Tokyo for dinner. The city has had a large Japanese population since the end of WWII due to the steel industry. We wanted ramen but got there too late to be seated before closing so settled for a place with okonomiyaki, tempura and soba. Back at the hotel we tried Killepitsch, a local liquer dating back to 1858 (it tasted like cherry coke syrup).</p>
            <p>The next day, we enjoyed a really all-out hotel breakfast buffet and went to the Rhine for a walk. Either side of the Rhine is lined with parks and beach and the large bridges crossing it are very pedestrian friendly. You can't swim in the Rhine but we sat and watched the passing river cruises, kayaks, jetskis and even a wakeboarder.</p>
            <p>Next time, I'd be interested to do a brewery tour and learn what makes an Alt beer an Alt beer. I had one, and it was a clear brown, with a clean taste and medium hoppiness/bitterness. They are served in tall narrow glasses, and we were told that the bars will keep them coming until you signal to stop by putting a coaster on the top.</p>

          <img src="img/ghent.jpg" alt="Ghent">

          <p>We took the train from Sittard to check out Ghent! We stayed at the Marriott, surrounded by centuries-old guild houses, in what we later learned was the former port bar and brothel. We learned about the city's history, rebellious spirit and fun stories on the city walking tour. We had some great food including lunch at an adorable teahouse called Alice, a small plates dinner we had at this little place called Joan, and Neuhaus chocolates. We did a lot of wandering and admiring architecture, and the city is just as lovely at night. Next time I'd like to go on one of the boats on the quay, maybe stay at the hostel, get some Belgian stew, visit the "Grandma candy" store, and try more of their fantastic beer.</p>

          <p>We went with a group to do a via ferrata in Dinant, Belgium. Dinant is on the Meuse River and surrounded by hills and steep cliffs. Our adventure started with the via ferrata, which is a “protected climbing path”, where you are attached by harness to guide wires and half climb/half walk up steep terrain. It was legitimately a bit scary to do, but very fun. After we did a couple of zip lines and then some wobbly bridge type obstacle courses. All in all, it was a very fun event and we hope to go back and try their kayak adventure.</p>

          <img src="img/amsterdam_rs.jpg" alt="Amsterdam">

          <p>We took the train to Amsterdam. The train station itself is gorgeous. We stayed at the Waldorf Astoria, on the herengracht, the canal that housed the most influential and richest members of the city in the 17th century. The hotel is made of several of these prominent houses combined. We had a fantastic dinner at The Seafood Bar in Spui, celebrating my promotion to Major! Wandering, we quickly stumbled upon the infamous Red Light District, taking in the *ahem* sites, and grabbed a chocolate smothered waffle to eat at the side of the canal.</p>

          <div id="amsterdam" class="more">
            <p>In the morning, we had breakfast at the hotel's Peacock Alley which was tasty and elegant with a variety of small plates. We followed with a visit to the Rijksmuseum, one of Amsterdam's most prominent museums, of the many, many museums they have. Its the largest art museum in the country, and with our limited attention span we made straight for the Rembrandt's and Vermeer's. Art appreciation complete, we made our way through the flower markets and tried one of the many herring vendors, eating the salted fish with onion and pickles (it was tasty and energizing after a lot of walking). After a quick tour of a local market, we had some pretty stellar ramen at Hinata, a place we happened upon. That afternoon we made for the other side of Amsterdam for an experience staying on a budget-priced hotel boat... I would not recommend staying at a budget-priced hotel boat, though it was an experience. Later, we grabbed a drink at the Cafe de Sluyswacht, a 1695 leaning building that used to house the keeper of the canal lock.</p>
            <p>On our final day, we finally did the "must" of Amsterdam, a canal tour by boat. Waiting for our tour, we explored the Canal Museum, which had a display on art restoration in a beautifully ornate building. Even though our boat tour started with some sprinkling rain, it was absolutely worth it to take in the city from yet another view and learn more of the history. We learned the Waldorf hotel itself was a bit of a scandal, as they bought up multiple properties on the canal in secret and then combined those interiors to the hotel it is now.</p>
            <p>Next visit, I'd like to see the Brouwerij 'T Ij, an Amsterdam brewery at a windmill (though apparently its owned by Belgians now? All the better). We meant to see Micropia, a microbiology museum (waterbears!), and the Anne Frank House, and I wouldn't say no to the Waldorf's Afternoon Tea. We also didn't explore the North side that you can reach by free ferry, and people often recommend visiting Haarlem to the West instead altogether.</p>

          <p>We drove south into Germany for a hike to a really amazing preserved 12th century castle, Burg Eltz. We paid an entry fee but also got a pretty great tour of the castle in English. The castle was built and lived in by three separate branches of the Eltz family. Amazingly, the castle was never attacked or destroyed, and is still owned by descendants of the Eltz family.</p>

We had a good lunch and stopped by Historische Senfmühle, a mustard mill, where we bought some local curry mustard. Next time it would be cool to visit Cochem Castle and to go up the mountain cable car (Sesselbahn) for a view.</p>

          <p>Newly settled into our apartment, we first travelled to Athens. We flew Transavia Airlines, a Netherlands-based budget airline, out of Eindhoven. Landing in Athens, we opted to take the bus to Syntagma Square. We saw the Hellenic Parliament building in passsing and made for our hostel, the Selina Theatrou Athens, in Psiri. That evening we ate at a vine-covered patio for Greek grill food in Psiri with live music playing bouzouki.</p>

          <div id="athens" class="more">
            <p>The next day we met our Mythology Walking Tour at the Temple of Olympus, and toured Hadrian's Arch, the Acropolis, and the Ancient Agora. The tour was really good and we met a couple from Ramstein and had lunch together. Afterwards we went through the Acropolis Museum. We made a quick tour of this museum, since much of the info had been covered on our walking tour. I really liked that the top floor was an oriented, full scale replica of the top of the Parthenon, allowing you to see all the carvings depicted along the top (and noting which had been stolen by the british). We had dinner at Atlantikos in Psiri for simple and delicious seafood. That evening we had drinks at the MS Roof Garden with a view of the Acropolis at night.</p>
            <p>The next day we picked up a rental car and made for Lake Vouliagmeni, a natural thermal lake in a collapsed cave with feet-nibbling fish. We had a relaxed lunch and swim, then went to the Southern tip of the Attica Peninsula to see the Temple of Poseidon. On the way back, we stopped for a seafood dinner on the water in Palaia Fokaia. We intended to swim but opted to go back to the hotel instead for a relaxed evening. </p>
            <p>Our last day, we went to a local clinic to get a Covid test done for our return flight the next day. This took well over an hour standing in line outside and we were frustrated by the complete inefficiency of the system. (We were vaccinated plus two weeks, but the Netherlands wasn't recognizing that at the time.) Tests complete, we went to the National Archaelogical Museum for lunch and a quick tour. We hiked up Filopappau Hill for a view of the Acropolis. That evening we had dinner at a tucked away seafood restaurant, Aiolou 68 (Bill thought they had paella, they did not) that was very good. That night we checked out the Psiri nightlife and had some dessert. </p>
            <p>It was amazing to visit Athens while tourist travel is low due to Covid, we were told places get ten times busier in a normal season. We had amazing seafood and I would definitely do that again, but I'd love to find a place with a good lamb kleftiko and traditional (non Greek grill) dishes. I'd like to visit the Peloppenese Region (western peninsula) and any of the islands of course and Crete.</p>

The city is a bit of a local tourist destination and also has a large casino, wellness spa and pool facility, toboggan slides, and a theme park. Valkenburg is one of my favorite cities. It has a nice downtown with winding cobblestone streets and cafes, crossing over the Geul river. Overlooking the city is the ruins of Valkenburg Castle, high on the hill. The castle was open for tours, and we walked around the ruins explaining its history and how it used to look.</p>

In the city center, we were able to see remnants of the early Roman baths, in a glass display in the middle of a park. Aachen is most known for being the capital of Charlemagne’s Frankish empire (8th century), and there is a museum in the city dedicated to that history (next time!). At the time of our visit, everything but grocery stores and bakeries were closed for Covid (bakeries are essential in Germany). Even still, we were able to see the main attraction, the Aachen Cathedral and City Hall (Rathaus).</p>

            <p>Since most places were closed, we took this opportunity to visit a McDonald’s and try the local special - a burger with Spargelweis (white asparagus). The German’s love this overgrown, bland asparagus that must be grown without exposure to sunlight (thus white), peeled and boiled for some 30 minutes. It is most commonly served with hollandaise sauce. It is so loved that the demand exceeds the Germans own production and it is imported in from other countries in the spring when it is in season. Anyway, I tried it on a burger and props to McDonald’s for trying, but the stringy texture of asparagus and dollop of hollandaise led to a sloppy disintegrating mess while contributing little to flavor. We later tried cooking Spargelweis ourselves (oh and the asparagus is expensive!) and decided its just not for us.</p>

          <p>My sponsor took us on a gorgeous hike in the wine country in Western Germany. We hiked a trail from the town of Altenahr to Mayschoβ. The trail follows the River Ahr through wine grape vineyards. In season, you can hike the trail and sample wine from vendors as you go! Since there were a lot of Covid restrictions at this time, I don’t know if they ever did that this year. At the start of the hike, we went to Burg Are, a ruined castle high on the hill. The view from there was amazing and it was fun to explore the ruins. At the end of the hike, we took the train back to the car. In the future it would be super cool to do this when you can drink wine as you hike, and also you can bike along the valley and the river a long ways and take the train back.</p>

          <p>One of our first trips was to Maastricht as we were considering renting an apartment there. We got a tour from a new friend that helped us take in all the highlights in a couple hours. The city is medieval, a college town and a tourist destination.</p>

            <p>We started in the main market square, that’s flanked by the 1664 City Hall building and hosts weekly markets. We visited Vrithof square, the most popular square of Maastricht, with its old cathedral and the “red tower”. We breezed through Boekhandel Dominacanen, a medieval gothic church converted into a bookstore. We passed through the Helpoort, a 13th century gate in the city’s preserved medieval fortifications. Finally, we went up to Fort Sint Peter, an 18th century hill fort that today provides a great overlook viewpoint for the city.</p>
            <p>Though Maastricht is a very nice city, we ultimately decided that the limited apartment size we could afford and the daily nuisance of parking and driving were too big of obstacles to overcome to live in this area. Instead we found a great place in Sittard!</p>
