          <p>We did a daytrip to the west coast of the Netherlands to see the Delta Works storm surge barrier, and the Kinderdijk windmills on the way home. Driving into Zeeland, the scenery reminded us of Anacortes, Washington, with open farm fields and low hills. Zeeland (“zee” means sea) is known for its shellfish farming and we were able to get local oysters and fish at the Seafarm Restaurant for lunch.</p>

          <div id="zeeland" class="more">
            <p>Afterwards we went to the “Delta Park Neeltje Jans” where we were able to tour the storm surge barrier and learn more about the history of its development. It is a really impressive civil engineering project that preserves the natural environment while protecting the region from flooding. In the event of a storm surge, large gates are lowered by hydraulic pistons, meeting with the sea bed to create a temporary dam. At this complex we also toured a small aquarium, a creepy walk-through whale exhibit, and met a couple seals. At the end, we boarded a tour boat that did a 45-minute tour of the estuary, and Bill got some good seagull closeups with the camera.</p>

            <p>From there, we left the coast for a more ancient location related to the Dutch’s war with the sea. At Kinderdijk, there stand nineteen 18th-century windmills, used to pump water for flood control of the low-lying polders. We were unable to visit the visitors center or the museum, but we were able to have a beautiful relaxed stroll down the canal along the windmills. With the setting sun, Bill was able to get some awesome photos with his camera.</p>

            <h3>Düsseldorf, Germany</h3>

          <img src="img/dusseldorf.jpg" alt="Düsseldorf Königsallee">

          <p>For the weekend, we drove to Düsseldorf, the capital of our region of Germany, North Rheinland Westphalia (NRW for short). The city is on the Rhine River and is named for the Düssel that feeds into it here. We started with a free walking tour, learning that Düsseldorf has a strong steel industry and a rivalry with upstream Cologne. Cologne used to be the capital of NRW, but after WWII, even though Düsseldorf had been bombed significantly, it was deemed in better shape than Cologne to take on the role of the Capital.</p>

          <div id="düsseldorf" class="more">
            <p>We visited the Alt Stadt (Old City), known for its Alt beer and the longest bar in the world. Nearby at the Rathaus (city hall) we learned of the tradition that at the start of Carnival a jester in a mustard pot makes jokes about the last year, while the Mayor stands at the Rathaus balcony. We walked the Königsallee (King's Avenue), which is a tree-lined canal bordered by high end shops and corporate offices. That evening we went to Little Tokyo for dinner. The city has had a large Japanese population since the end of WWII due to the steel industry. We wanted ramen but got there too late to be seated before closing so settled for a place with okonomiyaki, tempura and soba. Back at the hotel we tried Killepitsch, a local liquer dating back to 1858 (it tasted like cherry coke syrup).</p>
            <p>The next day, we enjoyed a really all-out hotel breakfast buffet and went to the Rhine for a walk. Either side of the Rhine is lined with parks and beach and the large bridges crossing it are very pedestrian friendly. You can't swim in the Rhine but we sat and watched the passing river cruises, kayaks, jetskis and even a wakeboarder.</p>
            <p>Next time, I'd be interested to do a brewery tour and learn what makes an Alt beer an Alt beer. I had one, and it was a clear brown, with a clean taste and medium hoppiness/bitterness. They are served in tall narrow glasses, and we were told that the bars will keep them coming until you signal to stop by putting a coaster on the top.</p>

          <img src="img/ghent.jpg" alt="Ghent">

          <p>We took the train from Sittard to check out Ghent! We stayed at the Marriott, surrounded by centuries-old guild houses, in what we later learned was the former port bar and brothel. We learned about the city's history, rebellious spirit and fun stories on the city walking tour. We had some great food including lunch at an adorable teahouse called Alice, a small plates dinner we had at this little place called Joan, and Neuhaus chocolates. We did a lot of wandering and admiring architecture, and the city is just as lovely at night. Next time I'd like to go on one of the boats on the quay, maybe stay at the hostel, get some Belgian stew, visit the "Grandma candy" store, and try more of their fantastic beer.</p>

          <p>We took the train to Amsterdam. The train station itself is gorgeous. We stayed at the Waldorf Astoria, on the herengracht, the canal that housed the most influential and richest members of the city in the 17th century. The hotel is made of several of these prominent houses combined. We had a fantastic dinner at The Seafood Bar in Spui, celebrating my promotion to Major! Wandering, we quickly stumbled upon the infamous Red Light District, taking in the *ahem* sites, and grabbed a chocolate smothered waffle to eat at the side of the canal.</p>

          <div id="amsterdam" class="more">
            <p>In the morning, we had breakfast at the hotel's Peacock Alley which was tasty and elegant with a variety of small plates. We followed with a visit to the Rijksmuseum, one of Amsterdam's most prominent museums, of the many, many museums they have. Its the largest art museum in the country, and with our limited attention span we made straight for the Rembrandt's and Vermeer's. Art appreciation complete, we made our way through the flower markets and tried one of the many herring vendors, eating the salted fish with onion and pickles (it was tasty and energizing after a lot of walking). After a quick tour of a local market, we had some pretty stellar ramen at Hinata, a place we happened upon. That afternoon we made for the other side of Amsterdam for an experience staying on a budget-priced hotel boat... I would not recommend staying at a budget-priced hotel boat, though it was an experience. Later, we grabbed a drink at the Cafe de Sluyswacht, a 1695 leaning building that used to house the keeper of the canal lock.</p>
            <p>On our final day, we finally did the "must" of Amsterdam, a canal tour by boat. Waiting for our tour, we explored the Canal Museum, which had a display on art restoration in a beautifully ornate building. Even though our boat tour started with some sprinkling rain, it was absolutely worth it to take in the city from yet another view and learn more of the history. We learned the Waldorf hotel itself was a bit of a scandal, as they bought up multiple properties on the canal in secret and then combined those interiors to the hotel it is now.</p>
            <p>Next visit, I'd like to see the Brouwerij 'T Ij, an Amsterdam brewery at a windmill (though apparently its owned by Belgians now? All the better). We meant to see Micropia, a microbiology museum (waterbears!), and the Anne Frank House, and I wouldn't say no to the Waldorf's Afternoon Tea. We also didn't explore the North side that you can reach by free ferry, and people often recommend visiting Haarlem to the West instead altogether.</p>

            <h3>Athens, Greece</h3>

          <img src="img/athens_rs.jpg" alt="Athens">

          <p>Newly settled into our apartment, we first travelled to Athens. We flew Transavia Airlines, a Netherlands-based budget airline, out of Eindhoven. Landing in Athens, we opted to take the bus to Syntagma Square. We saw the Hellenic Parliament building in passsing and made for our hostel, the Selina Theatrou Athens, in Psiri. That evening we ate at a vine-covered patio for Greek grill food in Psiri with live music playing bouzouki.</p>

          <div id="athens" class="more">
            <p>The next day we met our Mythology Walking Tour at the Temple of Olympus, and toured Hadrian's Arch, the Acropolis, and the Ancient Agora. The tour was really good and we met a couple from Ramstein and had lunch together. Afterwards we went through the Acropolis Museum. We made a quick tour of this museum, since much of the info had been covered on our walking tour. I really liked that the top floor was an oriented, full scale replica of the top of the Parthenon, allowing you to see all the carvings depicted along the top (and noting which had been stolen by the british). We had dinner at Atlantikos in Psiri for simple and delicious seafood. That evening we had drinks at the MS Roof Garden with a view of the Acropolis at night.</p>
            <p>The next day we picked up a rental car and made for Lake Vouliagmeni, a natural thermal lake in a collapsed cave with feet-nibbling fish. We had a relaxed lunch and swim, then went to the Southern tip of the Attica Peninsula to see the Temple of Poseidon. On the way back, we stopped for a seafood dinner on the water in Palaia Fokaia. We intended to swim but opted to go back to the hotel instead for a relaxed evening. </p>
            <p>Our last day, we went to a local clinic to get a Covid test done for our return flight the next day. This took well over an hour standing in line outside and we were frustrated by the complete inefficiency of the system. (We were vaccinated plus two weeks, but the Netherlands wasn't recognizing that at the time.) Tests complete, we went to the National Archaelogical Museum for lunch and a quick tour. We hiked up Filopappau Hill for a view of the Acropolis. That evening we had dinner at a tucked away seafood restaurant, Aiolou 68 (Bill thought they had paella, they did not) that was very good. That night we checked out the Psiri nightlife and had some dessert. </p>
            <p>It was amazing to visit Athens while tourist travel is low due to Covid, we were told places get ten times busier in a normal season. We had amazing seafood and I would definitely do that again, but I'd love to find a place with a good lamb kleftiko and traditional (non Greek grill) dishes. I'd like to visit the Peloppenese Region (western peninsula) and any of the islands of course and Crete.</p>
