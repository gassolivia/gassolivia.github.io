          <p>We biked to Maastricht on the Maasroute, except for the part where we lost the trail after lunch and ended up taking a more direct route the rest of the way. We took the train back and met some guys that had done the amateur Amstel Gold ride that day. I'd like to do that sometime. Taking bikes on the train was easy and we are talking about doing the Maasroute in sections, using the train to help get there and back for further sections, and maybe doing an overnight.</p>

              <p>We biked to Schinnen by way of Puth and stopped at Windraak 31 for lunch on the way back. Google sent us on a pedestrian only section on this ride which is always awkward. Puth had a good-sized hill but there were some interesting trails starting in Schinnen I'd like to explore and Oirsbeek was quite cute and has a windmill somewhere we need to find. As we often do, we stopped at Windraak 31 for lunch and I forgot to track the rest of the way back.</p>

              <p>This is a great loop from our house, circling around Sittard and then through farm roads through Germany passing fields and horses without cars or mopeds. From there we cut west to Windraak (it means "windbreak" and is a hamlet on a hill), usually stopping at Windraak 31 for lunch.</p>

              <p>Much to my surprise, the bike ride to base is super nice, with about half being through open farm fields with little to no traffic (occasionally you have to yield to a tractor). However the bit through Schinveld kind of sucks, with narrow brick streets, traffic and hills. I will try a modified, longer route next time to see if I can avoid Schinveld more. Fuck Schinveld.</p>

              <p>Our first bike ride in Europe! I wanted to check out this windmill I'd heard about, De Hompesche Molen. This was a bit longer of a ride and we had a not so fun section atop a narrow overgrown river dike all during Bill's allergy season. But shortly after we got on the Maasroute (by accident) and it became a much nicer ride. The windmill itself was cool and we ate at the little cafe and explored the nature area nearby.</p>
